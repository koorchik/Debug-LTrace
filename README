Debug-LTrace

Debug::LTrace instruments subroutines to provide tracing information
upon every call and return. Using Debug::LTrace does not require any changes to your sources.
The trace information is output using the standard warn() function.

It was inspired by Debug::Trace, but introduces new features such as
 1. Lexically scoped tracing
 2. Implements tracing in such way that the standard caller function works correctly
 3. Enable package tracing (using '*' syntax)
 4. Nice output formatting
 5. More debug information (time of execution, call context...)

Also Debug::LTrace supports Debug::Trace syntax (modifiers are not supported yet). 

Devel::TraceCalls - Powerful CPAN module but too complex API and not so convenient as Debug::Trace
